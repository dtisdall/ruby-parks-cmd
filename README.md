### A command line application for navigating park amenities

This app, built as a three hour hackathon challenge, consumes [open data](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/) from the NYC parks service and allows a user to drill down to locally available park amenities based on a simple inquiry starting with their zip code.

The purpose of this application was to demonstrate the ability to consume multiple XML sources and use them in a Ruby command line app.
